# 0x00. AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Description

The ALX AirBnB Clone project is expanding to include a web development aspect. This phase of the project focuses on creating the static HTML and CSS elements that will be used in the front end of the application. This involves designing, sketching, and prototyping each element that will be part of the AirBnB web application.

### Key Tasks:

- Create simple HTML static pages to represent different parts of the application.
- Develop a style guide to maintain a consistent design across the web pages.
- Populate the pages with fake content to visualize the final layout.
- No JavaScript or data loading is required at this stage.

## Static Web Pages

During this phase of the project, the goal is to create the static web pages that form the foundation of the AirBnB web application. These pages should have the structure and design in place, even though they won't be functional at this stage.

## How to Start

To work on the static web pages:

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/JeromeP93/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `web_static` directory:

   ```
   cd AirBnB_clone/web_static
   ```
3. Create and edit the HTML and CSS files in this directory to build the static web pages.
4. You can use a web browser to open the HTML files locally and view your progress.

## Style Guide

It's important to maintain a consistent design across the web pages. Create a style guide to define the fonts, colors, layouts, and other design elements used in the project.

## Fake Contents

For the purpose of prototyping and design, you can use fake or placeholder content to visualize the layout of the pages. This will give you a sense of how the pages will look when real data is integrated.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to structure your static web pages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>AirBnB Clone - Home</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Welcome to AirBnB</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Search</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Login</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>
        <main>
            <section>
                <h2>Featured Listings</h2>
                <div class="listing">
                    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Listing 1">
                    <h3>Cozy Apartment</h3>
                    <p>Stay in this comfortable apartment located in the heart of the city.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Add more listings here -->
            </section>
        </main>
        <footer>
            <p>Â© 2023 AirBnB Clone</p>
        </footer>
    </body>
</html>
```

This is a simplified example of an HTML structure for a page. You will need to create and style different pages for various sections of the AirBnB web application.
